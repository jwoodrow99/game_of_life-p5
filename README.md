# Game of Life P5.js

This is an implementation of the Game of Life in [P5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## The rules are very simple:

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies... "underpopulation".
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on... "next generation".
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies... "overpopulation".
* Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell... reproduction.

The source code for this project will be cleaned up if anyone takes the time to actually look haha. It is messy due to the fact that i made this in only a few hours with no tutorial, my latest speed code achievement, 2.5 hours!

I look forward to coding this in the J programming language next!ÃŸ
