## The rules are very simple:

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies... "underpopulated".
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors continue to live... "next generation".
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies... "overpopulation".
* Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell... "reproduction".

The source code for this project will be cleaned up if anyone takes the time to actually look haha. It is messy due to the fact that i made this in only a few hours with no tutorial, my latest speed code achievement, 2.5 hours!

I look forward to coding this in the J programming language next!
